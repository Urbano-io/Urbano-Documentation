## 2024-05-23 - [Centralizing Video Embed Styles]
**Learning:** Found inline `<style>` blocks for responsive video embeds in markdown files. This prevents global accessibility updates and consistent behavior.
**Action:** Moved styles to global `extra.css` and will watch for other inline styles in future markdown files to centralize them.

## 2024-05-24 - [Enhancing Navigation Clarity]
**Learning:** Text-only links in "grid cards" layouts can be easily missed. Using buttons with directional icons improves visibility and indicates "forward movement" more clearly. Explicitly linking to `index.md` in relative paths ensures consistent navigation behavior across different MkDocs configurations.
**Action:** Converted "Learn more" links to buttons with right-aligned arrows and fixed relative paths.
